# NeoWorldBuilder

Hey there! I want to share **NeoWorldBuilder** - a tool born from my love of worldbuilding and desire to organize creative ideas more effectively.

## Core Concepts

At its heart, NeoWorldBuilder uses four simple but powerful concepts:

### 1. Names

Everything in your world starts with a name - a character, location, or concept.

### 2. Descriptions

Where you breathe life into your creations with rich details and stories.

### 3. Labels

A way to define what something is - like marking elements as Characters, Locations, Events, or any category you dream up. Think of it as giving each piece of your world its own nature or type.

### 4. Relations

The magic that ties everything together. Characters interact with each other, places have histories, objects hold significance. Every connection makes your world feel more real and alive.

## Special Features

What makes it special is how naturally you can organize and explore your world:

* See your world as an interactive map of connections
* Find anything instantly through smart search
* Add images to visualize your creations
* Group related elements with tags
* Create rich, meaningful relationships between elements

It's like having a magical notebook that not only stores your ideas but helps you see how everything connects. Whether you're crafting a fantasy realm or designing a sci-fi universe, NeoWorldBuilder handles the organization so you can focus on what matters - creating amazing worlds.

I'd love to hear how you might use something like this in your creative process!
